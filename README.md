# Generalized-Langtons-Ant
Here I provide code for running a generalized version of Langton's Ant in Python. 
Read the PDF below by Ian Stewart for details on how variations of Langton's Ant can
be described using a rule string written in binary. In general it is also a very
fun read.

The file Langtons_Ant.py contains class definitions for running a Langtons Ant 
cellular automata. Simply running that script will run the original Langtons Ant.
Furthermore, various example scripts are written which run other variations on
Langtons Ant. Enjoy exploring the endless opportunities!
